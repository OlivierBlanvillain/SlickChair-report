# Introduction

Peer reviewing is a central process in the organisation of scientific conferences. It involves multiple interactions between it's participants: authors share their work with the program committee which is then in charge of reviewing these submissions. A program chair is designated to coordinate the process and decide on final submission acceptance. While this peer review process could be implemented by simply exchanging emails between participants, 
manually gathering submissions, assigning them to \pcms, aggregating the reviews and finally notifying the authors requires substantial efforts. The use of a dedicated software, called \cms, can greatly simplifies this process.

Over the last few years, numerous web based \cms have been developed. A recent comparative study @parra2013 shows that Easychair @easychair is by large the most popular platform, having been used in about 68% of conferences organized with online \cms. The following 4 systems in term of number of organized conferences are EDAS @edas with 8.5%, Open Conference Systems @ocs with 6%, START V2 @startv2 with 5.7% and ConfTool @conftool with 5.3%. However, out of these 5 systems, only Open Conference Systems is open-source. Easychair and ConfTool offer free licenses of their restricted versions and START V2 and EDAS are only available as a commercial product.

The importance and confidentiality of the data manipulated by a \cms imply that security a major concern when working with such system. Closed source solutions are often only available as hosted services, therefore requiring conference organisers to trust the company behind the product not only for the quality of the code, but also for the robustness of the infrastructure and the respect of data privacy. The open-source solutions we considered where not providing satisfactory levels of security. For example, Open Conference Systems sends a copy of the user passwords by email as plain text once the registration is completed. HotCRP @hotcrp, another open-source \cms, has a similar flaw: it sends login links to users with the password as part of the url. 

We present SlickChair, an open-source \cms written in Scala. Build with the Play framework and the Slick database access library, SlickChair provides a highly flexible and extensible solution to manage peer review processes. Our contributions are in particular:

# Overview of SlickChair

This section presents .. from the pov of different actors of the system: authors pcms and program chair. @mauro2005:

- Submission of abstracts and papers by Authors
- Submission of reviews by the Program Committee Members (PCM)
- Download of papers by Program Committee (PC)
- Handling of reviewers preferences and bidding
- Web-based assignment of papers to PCMs for review
- Review progress tracking
- Web-based PC meeting
- Notification of acceptance/rejection
- Sending e-mails for notifications

  1. Submission of papers
  2. Assignment to reviewers
  3. Mailings to PC members
  4. Submissions of reviews
  5. Reviewer comment threads
  6. Distributed PC meeting
  7. Letters to authors

Among his responsibilities, the assignment of submissions to \pcms can be a complex task. To be fair to all authors, submissions usually receive the same number of reviews, and this work has to be well distributed among \pcms so that no one overloaded. Moreover, \pcms might have conflicts of interests with certain submissions and different levels of knowledge depending on the topics. These constraints add up for

still the go to product because of the abstraction layer, the backup capabilities and the power of the query engine.

  - functional, immutable database
  - database as a value, queries as a function
  - timestamp implementation
